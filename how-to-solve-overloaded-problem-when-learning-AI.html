  <h1>First Get Touch with Leetcode</h1>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 8, 2025</p>

  <p>Today, I officially started practicing on Leetcode to build my algorithm and data structure foundation for becoming a capable AI engineer. I realized:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding problem patterns is critical.</li>
    <li>It's okay to check solutions to learn techniques like two-pointer, sliding window, and recursion.</li>
    <li>Practicing consistently is better than doing many at once.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I plan to do at least 2-3 problems daily while recording learnings, time spent, and the key concepts per problem in a local log for review.</p>

  <p>ðŸš€ Letâ€™s keep building!</p>
